about = ''
I'm a highly passionate and motivated engineer, in all my years as a computer entusiast, I've developed a quite broad set of skills,
which usually means that I'm able to tackle a wide range of problems, from low level programming to high level programming. I'm always
looking for new challenges and I'm always eager to learn new things and I love to have ideas to work on.

At the same time, I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge with others, so I ocassionally perform training sessions.'';
